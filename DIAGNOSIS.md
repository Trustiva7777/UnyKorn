# Server Issue Diagnosis

## Problem
The error "obscure-goggles-7r59r9xjpvgcpjww-5000.app.github.dev's server IP address could not be found" indicates the development server is not running.

## Root Cause
This is an **infrastructure issue**, not a code issue. The Vite dev server process has stopped or failed to start on port 5000.

## Code Status
âœ… All application code is complete and correct:
- App.tsx - Main application with routing
- All page components (HomePage, JoinPage, WalletPage, StatusPage, PartnersPage, AdminPage)
- All shared components (Navigation, ConstellationBackground, ValueFlowDiagram)
- All styling (index.css with proper theme)
- All configuration files (vite.config.ts, tsconfig.json, tailwind.config.js)

## What Needs to Happen
The development server needs to be restarted. This is typically done by:
1. The runtime automatically restarting the dev server
2. Or manually running `npm run dev` from the terminal

## Verification
Once the server restarts, the application should load successfully at the GitHub Codespace URL. All features are implemented:
- Constellation background animation
- Multi-page navigation
- XRPL wallet simulation
- Status dashboard
- Partners page
- Admin command hub

## Next Steps
The server restart should resolve the issue. No code changes are required.
