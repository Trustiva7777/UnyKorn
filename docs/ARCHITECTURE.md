# Architecture (Initial)

- apps/web: Next.js user portal
- apps/api: Express backend for users, projects, wallet, and AI orchestration
- packages/shared: Shared constants/utilities
- packages/ai-core: AI agent provisioning (placeholder)
- packages/web3: Web3 wallet integration (placeholder)

This is a foundation; we will iterate.
